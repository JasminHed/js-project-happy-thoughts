# Happy Thoughts
**Live Demo:** [https://happy-thoughtsapp.netlify.app](https://happy-thoughtsapp.netlify.app/)  

A social platform where users can share positive thoughts and spread happiness. This React application connects to a backend API to create a real-time feed of uplifting messages. Building this project taught me how to handle API integration in React, manage form submissions, and create engaging user interactions that encourage positivity.

## The Problem
I wanted to create a **positive social platform** that allows users to share uplifting thoughts and see them in real-time. The challenge was integrating a backend API with React, handling dynamic state updates, and creating a responsive, cheerful user interface.
